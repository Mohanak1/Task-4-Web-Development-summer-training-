Robot Arm Controller
This project is a control panel for a robotic arm built with Flutter, PHP, and MySQL. It allows the user to adjust motor positions, save and retrieve poses from a database, and send commands to run the arm. The backend PHP files are hosted in XAMPP (htdocs) and connected to a MySQL database, while the Flutter app handles the user interface and sends HTTP requests to the backend.
